#PC assemble and disassemble during TIS class

Reflection:
My group and I entered the PC lab class during TIS in this Semester, where our task was to meticulously remove and reassemble computer components. It was my first time meeting my group mates in this class, which was a lot of fun. We collaborated to complete the lab's objectives. We turned on the computer when we had finished assembly, and it functioned. After that, we had an exam on the same subject in which we had to write out each stage of the computer's reassembly.
